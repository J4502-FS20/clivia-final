<h1>Data of International students at MU</h1>
<p> Mizzou was home to approximately 1,814 international students.<br/>
Mizzou suggests that international students make up about 6.1% of the student body.<br/>
Chinese students could account for as much as 3.5% of the entire student body,<br/>
and as much as 58.0% of the international student body at Mizzou.<br/>
Over the past several years the total international population of students on campus has shrunk.<br/>
China was the largest contributor to this decline.<br/>
