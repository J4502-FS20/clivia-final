    <h2 class="story_name">Cat is Her Anidote</h2>
  <p class="story_description">
    Xiaolan Li, an international student from China, could not go back home under the impact of COVID-19 Pandemic.
    “It is dangerous for me to have a long flight home. Plus, when I go back home, it is likely that I cannot go back to Columbia to fulfill my studies,” Li said.
  <br/>She is a cat lover and has a cat in her home. Her mother often shares the lovely moments of her little cat at home when doing FaceTime with her.
According to Li, pandemic makes her more stressful than normal times. She feels sad when she misses her family and her cat.
  <br/>At the beginning of this semester, she decided to adopt a cat. She searched on craigslist, a forum with a variety of information regarding pets.
Finally, she brought a little cat home. She calls him Boba.
  <br/>Up to now, Boba has accompanied her for around two months.
“I feel more relived when I can play with him every day,” Li said.
“For me, the cat is my antidote.”

    <h2 class="story_name">A Taste From Home</h2>
  <p class="story_description">
    Cecilia Yue loves to brew tea when she wants to get away from schoolwork. She makes tea in a Chinese traditional way.
  She inherits her love of tea from her father. She said making tea is a way to relax herself during COVID-19.
    <br/>A 10% tariff was imposed on Chinese tea in September 2019. In mid-February, the tariff was lowered to 7.5%.
The uncertainty of tariff policy on tea makes it harder for traditional tea lovers like Cecilia Yue to purchase loose tea leaves in the U.S.
<br/>“Tea to Chinese people is like Coffee to American people,” Cecilia Yue said.
Because of COVID-19, she did not go back home this summer.
She said she misses time drinking tea with her family members.
For her, tea symbolizes a taste of home.

    <h2 class="story_name">Universities, international students celebrate demise of ICE 'go home' rule</h2>
  <p class="story_description">
    Some international students were rejoicing after hearing the Trump administration has rescinded an Immigration and Customs Enforcement directive that would have forced them to go home
     if they ended up taking all online classes in the fall.
    <br/>But some were still not sure whether they would come back to Columbia from their countries as uncertainty persists during the pandemic.
